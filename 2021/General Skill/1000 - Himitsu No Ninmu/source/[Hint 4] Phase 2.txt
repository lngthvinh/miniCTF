That's an interesting cipher, isn't it xD
But this is not the end yet xD
Next step: There are strange noises in this music. The creator of this video told me it's mo*se sound. That sound will show you who you need to find. Can you figure out what that sound says?
Music: https://sal.vn/FDuBe2 (link gá»‘c: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J97ORP768HI)
And here's some information about who you're looking for. His profile is kept where the blue bird icon is and can be found with the last 15 characters of the sound after remove all space (ex: abcdeFgHijklmNo)
Good luck :>
P/S: Hear the sound with Romanji
